### Classification Performance

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
                    Predicted
                BENIGN    ATTACK
Actual  BENIGN   8,840        22
        ATTACK     282    32,858
```

**Detailed Metrics:**

**False Positives:**
- Expected: ~25 false positives per 10,000 benign events
- Industry Average: 100-500 false positives
- **Improvement:** 4-20x reduction in analyst workload

**False Negatives:**
- Expected: ~85 missed attacks per 10,000 true attacks
- Critical Attack Detection: 99.15% probability
- **Risk:** Acceptable with proper defense-in-depth
