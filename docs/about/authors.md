## Acknowledgments

This implementation builds directly upon the foundational survey paper "AI-Augmented SOC: A Survey of LLMs and Agents for Security Automation" authored by the research team listed above.

The survey's systematic literature review (500+ papers using PRISMA methodology) provided the theoretical framework and research questions that guided this implementation.

The production codebase, deployment automation, ML model training, and system architecture were developed by Abdul Bari as a practical validation of the survey's findings.
