  "task": "Comprehensive AI-SOC Intelligence Gathering",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "summary": {
    "key_findings": [
      "TOP 3 Datasets: CICIDS2017 (2.8M instances), UNSW-NB15 (100GB), CICIoT2023 (latest IoT attacks)",
      "Best LLM for Security: Foundation-Sec-8B (Llama 3.1 based, matches 70B performance on security tasks)",
      "Production-Ready Stack: Wazuh + OpenSearch + TheHive + Suricata + Ollama (all actively maintained 2024)",
      "Critical Tool: LibreLog (fastest LLM log parser, 2.7x faster than LILAC, 25% higher accuracy)",
      "SOC Metrics: MTTD <4hrs, MTTR <4hrs, FPR <25% critical, BERT F1-score 99.3% for anomaly detection",
      "RAG Reduces Hallucinations: 30-40% reduction with structured retrieval, critical for security contexts"
    ],
    "opportunities": [
      "Exploit 2024 CIC datasets (IoT-DIAD, IoMT, Tabular IoT) - most current attack vectors available",
      "Leverage Foundation-Sec-8B for on-prem deployment - designed for SOC acceleration and threat defense",
      "Integrate AGIR (40% faster CTI reports) + AttackGen (MITRE ATT&CK scenarios) for report automation",
      "Deploy Shuffle SOAR + TheHive integration (TheHive5 now commercial, creates urgency for open alternatives)",
      "Implement LibreLog + LogBatcher for log parsing (state-of-art 2024, outperforms existing solutions)",
      "Use ChromaDB + LangGraph for RAG architecture (Docker-compatible, production-proven at Trellix)"
    ],
    "competitors": [
      "Academic: Multiple LLM4Cybersecurity GitHub repos, but mostly research papers - no production systems",
      "Commercial: Dropzone.ai (99.93% accuracy), Intezer (AI SOC automation) - but closed source",
      "Open Source Gap: No comprehensive AI-SOC exists - Wazuh + SOAR integrations exist separately",
      "Opportunity: First fully-integrated open-source AI-SOC with LLM capabilities would fill major gap"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Priority 1: Use CICIDS2017 for initial prototype (most accessible, Kaggle/IEEE available, 2.8M records)",
      "Priority 2: Deploy Foundation-Sec-8B via Ollama Docker (cybersecurity-optimized, Apache license)",
      "Priority 3: Start with Wazuh + OpenSearch stack (official Docker images, active 2024 development)",
      "Priority 4: Integrate ChromaDB + LangGraph for RAG (proven SOC use case at Trellix)",
      "Priority 5: Implement LibreLog for log parsing (fastest, most accurate 2024 solution)"
