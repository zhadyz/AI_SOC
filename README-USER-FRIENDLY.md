## Graphical Control Interface

The launcher interface provides integrated system management through a desktop application:

### Control Functions

- **START AI-SOC** - Initiates Docker Compose orchestration for all platform services
- **STOP AI-SOC** - Executes graceful shutdown of all containers
- **Open Dashboard** - Launches web-based monitoring interface in default browser

### Status Monitoring

The interface employs color-coded indicators for system health visualization:

- **Green** - All services operational and healthy
- **Yellow** - Services in initialization state (transient)
- **Red** - Service failure requiring attention

### Service Status Panel

Real-time display of component operational status:

- Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch backend)
- Wazuh Manager (SIEM core)
- ML Inference (Machine learning engine)
- Alert Triage (Prioritization service)
- RAG Service (Knowledge augmentation)
- ChromaDB (Vector database)

---

## Web-Based Monitoring

**Access URL:** http://localhost:3000

### Dashboard Features

The browser-based interface provides:

- Real-time system status aggregation
- Individual service health monitoring
- Visual health indicators with color coding
- Automatic status refresh (5-second polling interval)

**Authentication:** Not required for localhost deployment (system operates on local loopback interface)

---

## Deployment Methodology Comparison

### Traditional Command-Line Deployment

Conventional deployment requires multiple manual operations:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/AI_SOC
$ cp .env.example .env
$ vim .env  # Manual configuration editing
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose/phase1-siem-core-windows.yml up -d
$ docker ps  # Service status verification
$ docker logs wazuh-manager  # Diagnostic log review
```

**Operational Complexity:** Requires Docker CLI expertise, manual configuration, and diagnostic capabilities.

### Simplified Graphical Deployment

The launcher interface abstracts technical complexity:

```
1. Execute START-AI-SOC.bat
2. Select "START AI-SOC"
3. Monitor automated deployment via status panel
```

**Operational Complexity:** Minimal technical knowledge required; suitable for non-specialist deployment.
