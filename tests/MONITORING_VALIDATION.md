## Overview

This document validates the monitoring and observability infrastructure for the AI-SOC platform.

---

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Prometheus Metrics

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED IN SERVICES

**Alert Triage Service (`services/alert-triage/main.py`):**
```python
# Metrics endpoints found:
- REQUEST_COUNT: Counter for total requests
- REQUEST_DURATION: Histogram for request duration
- ANALYSIS_CONFIDENCE: Histogram for confidence scores
- /metrics endpoint: Prometheus exposition format
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Prometheus metrics defined
- ✅ /metrics endpoint exposed
- ✅ Counter and Histogram metrics used
- ⚠️ Prometheus server not yet deployed

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Integration tests validate /metrics endpoint
- ✅ E2E tests check metrics during workflows
- ✅ Load tests generate metrics data

---

### 2. Health Check Endpoints

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED ACROSS ALL SERVICES

**Services with Health Checks:**
1. **Alert Triage** (`/health`) - Returns service status + Ollama connectivity
2. **ML Inference** (`/health`) - Returns models loaded count
3. **RAG Service** (`/health`) - Returns ChromaDB connection status

**Validation:**
- ✅ Health endpoints return JSON
- ✅ Include dependency status (Ollama, ChromaDB)
- ✅ Return 200 OK when healthy
- ⚠️ Need to implement degraded state (503)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Unit tests validate health endpoint responses
- ✅ Integration tests check multi-service health
- ✅ E2E tests verify health during workflows

---

### 3. Logging

**Status:** ✅ STRUCTURED LOGGING IMPLEMENTED

**Logging Configuration:**
```python
# services/common/logging_config.py
- Structured JSON logging
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Contextual logging with correlation IDs
```

**Log Aggregation:**
- ⚠️ ELK Stack not yet deployed
- ⚠️ Log shipping not configured
- ✅ Log sanitization implemented (security.py)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Security tests validate log sanitization
- ✅ Sensitive data redaction verified
- ⚠️ Log aggregation tests pending

---

### 4. Alerting

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current State:**
- ✅ Prometheus metrics available
- ⚠️ Grafana not deployed
- ⚠️ Alert rules not configured
- ⚠️ Notification channels not set up

**Recommended Alert Rules:**

```yaml
# High error rate
- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: rate(triage_requests_total{status="failed"}[5m]) > 0.05
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "High error rate detected"

# Slow response time
- alert: SlowResponseTime
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, triage_request_duration_seconds) > 30
  for: 10m
  annotations:
    summary: "95th percentile latency >30s"

# Low confidence alerts
- alert: LowConfidenceAlerts
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.50, triage_confidence_score) < 0.7
  for: 15m
  annotations:
    summary: "Median confidence score <70%"

# Service down
- alert: ServiceDown
  expr: up{job="alert-triage"} == 0
  for: 2m
  annotations:
    summary: "Alert Triage service is down"
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ⚠️ Alerting tests pending Grafana deployment
- ⚠️ Alert rule validation pending

---

### 5. Tracing

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Recommendation:** Implement distributed tracing for E2E visibility

**Suggested Tools:**
- Jaeger or Zipkin for distributed tracing
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- Correlation IDs across services

**Benefits:**
- Track requests across microservices
- Identify bottlenecks
- Debug complex workflows
- Measure E2E latency

**Test Coverage:**
- ⚠️ Tracing tests pending implementation

---

### Integration Tests

**Multi-Service Health:**
- ✅ `test_service_integration.py::TestMultiServiceHealth::test_all_services_healthy`
- ✅ `test_service_integration.py::TestMultiServiceHealth::test_service_dependencies`

**Metrics Collection:**

## Conclusion

**Monitoring Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

The AI-SOC platform has excellent foundation for monitoring:
- ✅ Metrics collection ready
- ✅ Health checks comprehensive
- ✅ Logging properly structured

However, the observability stack needs deployment:
- ⚠️ Prometheus server not running
- ⚠️ Grafana dashboards not deployed
- ⚠️ Alerting rules not configured

**Verdict:** The monitoring infrastructure is well-designed and tested, but requires deployment and configuration before production use.
